Different variable used and their meanings

1. fVector: All the features labels are  read into fVector.
	It has 561 values and 477 levels

2. fmeanStd : The mean and standard deviation for each measurement is extracted in this. It represents TRUE and FALSE.

3. activities : Different human activites are given in activity_labels.txt are read into it. activities has six values such as LAYING SITTING STANDING WALKING WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS WALKING_UPSTAIRS

4. xtrain : Contains data given in X_train.txt, These are labeled using fVector and mean std value are extracted using fmeanStd.

5. ytrain : Contains data given in y_train.txt"), Later activities are added as second column and labeled using c("Activity_ID", "Activity_Label").

6. train : Contains data given in  subject_train.txt", These are labeled subject later.


7.xtest: Contains data given in X_test.txt. These are labeled using fVector and mean std value are extracted using fmeanStd.

8.ytest : Contains data given in y_test.txt, Later activities are added as second column and labeled using c("Activity_ID", "Activity_Label").

9. test: Contains data given in subject_test.txt, These are labeled subject later.


10. train_data: column binding of train, ytrain and xtrain.


11. test_data : Column binding of test, ytest, xtes


12. test_train = Row binding of test_data, train_data

13. id_labels   These are label vector c("subject", "Activity_ID", "Activity_Label")
14. data_labels = generated using setdiff command
15. melt_data      : generated using melt command.


16. tidy_data   Finally tidy_data is generated by applying mean function to dataset using dcast function
